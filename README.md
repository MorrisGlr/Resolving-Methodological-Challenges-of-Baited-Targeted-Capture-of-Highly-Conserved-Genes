# Resolving Methodological Challenges of Baited Targeted Capture of Highly Conserved Genes

While using genomic-DNA targeted gene capture and amplification to build a phylogeny, we encountered challenges within the gene capture procedures. Although gene capture promises an efficient protocol for massively paralleled sequencing, we will introduce several modifications to this technique to give gene capture users more reproducibility and control over this novel yet laborious technique. This poster will follow the work flow of one mollusk tissue sample. The major steps of the gene capture workflow are divided into sections and are characterized by Tapestation DNA traces that represent an optimized sample and a problematic sample. Additionally, the rationale of each new step that circumvents gene capture challenges is described.
